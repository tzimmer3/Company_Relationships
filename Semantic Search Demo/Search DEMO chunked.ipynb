BloombergNEF tracked a record number of activities in 2022. Feedstock recycling uses a chemical process to break down plastic waste into a hydrocarbon mix that can be used to make new, virgin-grade plastic again. Many plastics producers like Dow and ExxonMobil are betting on feedstock recycling to boost their recycled production. Dow aims to produce 3 million metric tons of sustainable plastic by 2030. Supply agreements account for the largest share of feedstock recycling activities at 51%, as sourcing recycled feedstock remains a challenge for producers. The likes of TotalEnergies and CP Chem have formed agreements with recyclers including Nexus Circular, New Hope Energy and Plastic Energy. As demand for recycled plastics grows, more chemicals companies may choose to vertically integrate through partnerships and investments to source the feedstock needed to meet production targets.This Short is from: 1Q 2023 Sustainable Materials Market Outlook: Policy Push</td>\n",

The net-zero aspiration applies to Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and builds on ExxonMobil’s 2030 emission-reduction plans, which include net-zero emissions for Permian Basin operations and ongoing investments in lower-emission solutions in which it has extensive experience, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. “ExxonMobil is committed to playing a leading role in the energy transition, and Advancing Climate Solutions articulates our deliberate approach to helping society reach a lower-emissions future,” said Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are developing comprehensive roadmaps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operated assets around the world, and where we are not the operator, we are working with our partners to achieve similar emission-reduction results.” The report provides details of how ExxonMobil’s business strategy is resilient when tested against a range of Paris-aligned net-zero</td>\n",

Our scientists are working to develop innovative solutions to help reduce emissions, with a focus on the highest emitting and most difficult to decarbonize sectors of the economy: commercial transportation, power generation and heavy industry. It is in these areas where we believe ExxonMobil can best contribute to the challenge of climate change. For example, through our new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business we are advancing plans for large-scale emission reductions with new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world. We are also leveraging ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with carbon capture and storage, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. We’re investing $3 billion on lower-emission energy solutions through 2025 on top of $10 billion we’ve spent over the past two decades. As we develop additional value-added opportunities, I expect these investments to grow. We believe a price on carbon emissions is essential to achieving net zero emissions.

Future spending plans take into account potential market volatility as the economy recovers from the pandemic. “Our investments are expected to generate returns of greater than 30 percent,” said Woods. “And 90 percent of our upstream investments in resource additions, including in Guyana, Brazil and the U.S. Permian Basin, generate a 10 percent return at $35 per barrel or less.

ExxonMobil to expand carbon capture and storage at LaBarge, Wyoming, facility Share Print Top Estimated $400 million investment further reduces greenhouse gas emissions, supporting corporate-wide emission-reduction plans Annual carbon captured to increase by approximately 1.2 million metric tons Front-end engineering design complete; potential startup in 2025 “Carbon capture and storage is a readily available technology that can play a critical role in helping society reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Joe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. “By expanding carbon capture and storage at LaBarge, we can reduce emissions from our operations and continue to demonstrate the large-scale capability for carbon capture and storage to address emissions from vital sectors of the global economy, including industrial manufacturing.” ExxonMobil completed front-end engineering and design work for the project in December 2021 and expects to issue the engineering, procurement and construction contract in March. Pending regulatory approvals, startup is estimated in 2025. The expansion is part of the company’s 2030 emission-reduction plans and supports the company’s ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) for its operated assets by 2050.

Forget Peak Oil Demand: A Thirst for Barrels Puts $100 in View Oil consumption is heading for a record this year, according to the International Energy Agency, which advises major economies. Supply — buffeted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a slowdown in US shale growth and lackluster investment in production — hasn’t kept pace. BP’s estimates for oil investment requirements are lower than that of OPEC, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expecting a need for $12.1 trillion to 2045. The European oil major anticipates that, at most, the sector will need slightly more than $400 billion a year until 2050. OPEC, the IEA and BP’s estimates “vary widely,” Cohen said. “Its not sensible to get bogged down in the details, what’s clear is we need to keep investing as we have been in the past.” The company is also targeting investment in green hydrogen and biofuels. It is focused on growing these areas in Latin America, said Angelica Ruiz, BP’s senior vice president for Latin America. “We are not only doing more, but we have acquired new companies that underpin this new growth engine that we believe is critical.” ( Updates with information on BP and oil market dynamics in fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs.

ExxonMobil statement regarding President Biden Letter to Oil Industry Share Print Top We have been in regular contact with the administration to update the President and his staff on how ExxonMobil has been investing more than any other company to develop U.S. oil and gas supplies. This includes investments in the U.S. of more than $50 billion over the past five years, resulting in an almost 50% increase in our U.S. production of oil during this period. Globally, we’ve invested double what we’ve earned over the past five years -- $118 billion on new oil and gas supplies compared to net income of $55 billion. This is a reflection of the company’s long-term growth strategy, and our commitment to continuously invest to meet society’s demand for our products. Specific to refining capacity in the U.S., we’ve been investing through the downturn to increase refining capacity to process U.S. light crude by about 250,000 barrels per day – the equivalent of adding a new medium-sized refinery. We kept investing even during the pandemic, when we lost more than $20 billion and had to borrow more than $30 billion to maintain investment to increase capacity to be ready for post-pandemic demand. In the short term, the U.S. government could enact measures often used in emergencies following hurricanes or other supply disruptions -- such as waivers of Jones Act provisions and some fuel specifications to increase supplies.

It also would enable the site to manufacture lower-emissions products for its customers. Access to surplus hydrogen and CO2 storage capacity would be made available to nearby industry. The project would form ExxonMobil’s initial contribution to a broad, cross-industry effort to establish a Houston carbon capture and storage hub with an initial target of about 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030, and 100 million metric tons by 2040. Evaluation and planning for the Baytown project are ongoing and, subject to stakeholder support, regulatory permitting and market conditions, a final investment decision is expected in two to three years. ExxonMobil has extensive experience with hydrogen and already produces about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The company is uniquely positioned to participate in the growing hydrogen market and is evaluating strategic investments to increase the use of this important lower-emissions energy technology. Equally important is the company’s more than 30 years of experience capturing and permanently storing CO2. ExxonMobil has cumulatively captured more human-made CO2 than any other company and has an equity share of about one-fifth of the world’s carbon capture and storage capacity, which amounts to about 9 million metric tons per year.
