A house that floats in floods Following destructive flooding in Japan in 2015, real estate developer Ichijo Co. designed a “floating house” to guard against future threats. Once water levels exceed roughly 1 meter (3.3 feet), the entire building essentially rises to the water’s surface. When the water retreats, the building returns to its original location with a margin of error smaller than the length of a human thumb, thanks to four poles that connect the house to the ground and stabilize its movement. Ichijo makes another design of its house that doesn’t float, but instead directs floodwater to a designated indoor flooding zone to mitigate damage after water levels exceed 1 meter. Both designs come equipped with waterproof windows and doors, as well as a special drainage system to prevent overflows in the kitchen, toilets and bathtubs. The company says it has built more than 1,000 flood-resilient homes since 2020, but does not break out how many of its sales were of floating homes. Once water levels exceed 1 meter (3.3 feet), the Ichijo house — undergoing a test run here — is designed to float.

Overseas investors were involved in most of the $2.6 billion merger and acquisition deals in the country in 2022.\\n\\nThe largest M&A deal in India last year was oil and gas major Shell Plc's acquisition of Sprng Energy from private equity firm Actis LLP for $1.55 billion. To fulfill its green ambitions in the country, Shell has made multiple investments across energy and transport sectors. In the renewables space, it had acquired minority stakes in Indian solar companies Orb Energy and Cleantech Solar.\\n\\nSingaporean conglomerate Keppel Corp., UK's ThomasLloyd Energy Impact Trust and Abu Dhabi-based investor International Holding Company PJSC are among other foreign companies that closed M&A deals in India's renewable energy sector in 2022.\\n\\nFunds raised from all sources by India\\u2019s clean energy activities reached $19.9 billion in 2022, 29% less than $28 billion closed in 2021. More than half of this amount was secured for building new renewable power projects.This Short is from: 1H 2023 India Renewables Market Outlook: A Turbulent Time\",\n",

       "    'Article Text': 'live in and being prepared for that, so a bad day isn’t a tragic day.” Here are four examples of architectural designs meant to better withstand climate impacts. A house that floats in floods Following destructive flooding in Japan in 2015, real estate developer Ichijo Co. designed a “floating house” to guard against future threats. Once water levels exceed roughly 1 meter (3.3 feet), the entire building essentially rises to the water’s surface. When the water retreats, the building returns to its original location with a margin of error smaller than the length of a human thumb, thanks to four poles that connect the house to the ground and stabilize its movement. Ichijo makes another design of its house that doesn’t float, but instead directs floodwater to a designated indoor flooding zone to mitigate damage after water levels exceed 1 meter. Both designs come equipped with waterproof windows and doors, as well as a special drainage system to prevent overflows in the kitchen, toilets and bathtubs. The company says it has built more than 1,000 flood-resilient homes since 2020, but does not break out how many of its sales were of floating homes. Once water levels exceed 1 meter (3.3 feet), the Ichijo house — undergoing a test run here — is designed to float.
