       "It is in these areas where we believe ExxonMobil can best contribute to the challenge of climate change. For example, through our new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business we are advancing plans for large-scale emission reductions with new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world. We are also leveraging ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with carbon capture and storage, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. We’re investing $3 billion on lower-emission energy solutions through 2025 on top of $10 billion we’ve spent over the past two decades.  As we develop additional value-added opportunities, I expect these investments to grow.\n",
       "\n",
       "We believe a price on carbon emissions is essential to achieving net zero emissions. Carbon pricing would send a clear signal through the market, creating incentives to reduce emissions, fostering investment in R&D to advance solutions and providing consumers with transparency to make the best choices.\n",
       "\n",
       "While there is some resistance to a carbon tax, we are actively and publicly discussing other options, including lower-carbon fuels and other sector-based approaches that would place a uniform, predictable cost on carbon. Today, through government regulation and incentives, we are paying to reduce carbon throughout the economy. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know what it’s costing.  We think it’s vitally important for the cost of reducing carbon to be more transparent to enable comparisons of the various options to help policy makers reduce emissions at the lowest overall cost to society.\n",
       "\n",
       "We are actively working to reduce our own emissions. Overall, we have reduced operated greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent from 2016 to 2020, and we’ve laid out plans for significant further reductions by 2025.  We are also working to find new and better ways to monitor and reduce methane emissions, including collaborations with universities, environmental groups and other industry partners. Through 2020, we reduced methane emissions nearly 34 percent across our U.S. unconventional operations, compared to 2016 when the Paris Agreement was signed.\n",

       "We have been in regular contact with the administration to update the President and his staff on how ExxonMobil has been investing more than any other company to develop U.S. oil and gas supplies. This includes investments in the U.S. of more than $50 billion over the past five years, resulting in an almost 50% increase in our U.S. production of oil during this period.\n",
       "\n",
       "Globally, we’ve invested double what we’ve earned over the past five years -- $118 billion on new oil and gas supplies compared to net income of $55 billion. This is a reflection of the company’s long-term growth strategy, and our commitment to continuously invest to meet society’s demand for our products.\n",
       "\n",
       "Specific to refining capacity in the U.S., we’ve been investing through the downturn to increase refining capacity to process U.S. light crude by about 250,000 barrels per day – the equivalent of adding a new medium-sized refinery. We kept investing even during the pandemic, when we lost more than $20 billion and had to borrow more than $30 billion to maintain investment to increase capacity to be ready for post-pandemic demand. \n",
       "\n",
       "In the short term, the U.S. government could enact measures often used in emergencies following hurricanes or other supply disruptions -- such as waivers of Jones Act provisions and some fuel specifications to increase supplies. Longer term, government can promote investment through clear and consistent policy that supports U.S. resource development, such as regular and predictable lease sales, as well as streamlined regulatory approval and support for infrastructure such as pipelines.</td>\n",

       "The presentation highlights the new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business, which is working to commercialize technologies to reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as power generation, commercial transportation and heavy industry. The technologies include carbon capture and storage (CCS), which will be the initial focus of Low Carbon Solutions, as well as hydrogen, and advanced biofuels. Demand for these lower-emission technologies could create multi-trillion dollar markets by 2040. ExxonMobil is the global leader in CCS, and has captured approximately 40 percent of all anthropogenic CO2 ever captured, the equivalent to planting approximately 2 billion trees.\n",
       "\n",
       "ExxonMobil recently announced a multi-industry CCS concept that has the potential to significantly decarbonize heavy industries located near the Houston ship channel; early projections indicate that, with the appropriate enablers, it could remove approximately 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2040. The lower-carbon business opportunities leverage decades of ExxonMobil experience in deploying technology at scale, and competitive advantages demonstrated in its existing businesses. In addition, the company’s 2025 emission-reduction plans are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement and a 2-degree pathway.\n",

       "\n",
       "“Hydrogen has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in key sectors of the global economy that create valuable products that support modern life,” said Dan Ammann, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. “This study will explore the potential for ExxonMobil’s Slagen fuel terminal to help reduce emissions from Norway’s maritime sector and help achieve society’s net-zero ambitions.”\n",

       "“Slagen is an exceptionally suitable location as a central hub for hydrogen and ammonia to the maritime sector,” said Matt Duke, CEO of Grieg Maritime Group. “With the complementary expertise amongst the MOU partners, we have now taken an important next step in our efforts to achieve emissions reductions in the maritime sector.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The International Energy Agency projects hydrogen will meet 10% of global energy needs by 2050, and says it is critical to achieving societal net-zero global emissions. The Norwegian government has published a road map for hydrogen that includes establishing low-emissions hydrogen hubs along the coast of Norway. The Slagen terminal is located at the opening of the Oslofjord, where more than 10,000 ships pass through every year.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is high value in producing green hydrogen close to where consumption is,” said Morten S. Watle, CEO of GreenH. “At Slagen, bunkering of hydrogen could be offered straight from the production facility.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "ExxonMobil is working to commercialize lower-emission technologies and support society’s net-zero ambitions by leveraging the skills, knowledge and scale of the business. In addition to evaluating development of ammonia and hydrogen, the company is pursuing strategic investments in carbon capture and storage and biofuels to help bring those lower-emissions energy technologies to scale for hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the global economy.\n",

       "We understand the tremendous challenge represented by climate change and have fully supported the Paris Agreement since its inception. Our scientists are working to develop innovative solutions to help reduce emissions, with a focus on the highest emitting and most difficult to decarbonize sectors of the economy: commercial transportation, power generation and heavy industry. \n",
       "\n",
       "It is in these areas where we believe ExxonMobil can best contribute to the challenge of climate change. For example, through our new ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business we are advancing plans for large-scale emission reductions with new carbon capture and storage opportunities around the world. We are also leveraging ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the production of hydrogen which, when coupled with carbon capture and storage, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. We’re investing $3 billion on lower-emission energy solutions through 2025 on top of $10 billion we’ve spent over the past two decades.  As we develop additional value-added opportunities, I expect these investments to grow.\n",
       "\n",
       "We believe a price on carbon emissions is essential to achieving net zero emissions. Carbon pricing would send a clear signal through the market, creating incentives to reduce emissions, fostering investment in R&D to advance solutions and providing consumers with transparency to make the best choices.\n",
       "\n",
       "While there is some resistance to a carbon tax, we are actively and publicly discussing other options, including lower-carbon fuels and other sector-based approaches that would place a uniform, predictable cost on carbon. Today, through government regulation and incentives, we are paying to reduce carbon throughout the economy. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know what it’s costing.  We think it’s vitally important for the cost of reducing carbon to be more transparent to enable comparisons of the various options to help policy makers reduce emissions at the lowest overall cost to society.\n",
       "\n",
       "We are actively working to reduce our own emissions. Overall, we have reduced operated greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent from 2016 to 2020, and we’ve laid out plans for significant further reductions by 2025.  We are also working to find new and better ways to monitor and reduce methane emissions, including collaborations with universities, environmental groups and other industry partners. Through 2020, we reduced methane emissions nearly 34 percent across our U.S. unconventional operations, compared to 2016 when the Paris Agreement was signed.\n",
       "\n",
       "We have great respect for policy makers, elected officials and organizations across the political spectrum who are grappling to effectively address climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our time.  ExxonMobil’s position is clear: we want to be part of the solution while responsibly providing affordable energy required to power the economy.
