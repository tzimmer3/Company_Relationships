He notes that while “a small number of companies actually withdrew their memberships due to policy differences (in 2019, for example, Royal Dutch Shell canceled its membership with the American Fuel and Petrochemicals Manufacturers over its difference on climate change policy), most choose to remain and debate association advocacy priorities.” The resulting divisions “often result in unclear and ineffective advocacy.” During the “latter stages of the U.S. Senate debate on the Inflation Reduction Act, conservative Republicans contacted the American Petroleum Institute (API) to more vigorously oppose the legislation.” Because members such as “Chevron and Exxon Mobil stood to benefit from generous funding provided for carbon capture and storage and development of hydrogen, API’s opposition was more muted.”</td>\n",
